## IceBridge Arctic sea ice topography scripts

Data processing and plotting used to assess Arctic sea ice topography using high-resolution IceBridge laser (ATM) data, from the following publication:

Petty, A. A., M. C. Tsamados, N. T. Kurtz, S. L. Farrell, T. Newman, J. Harbeck, D. L. Feltham, J. A. Richter-Menge (2016), Characterizing Arctic sea ice topography using high-resolution IceBridge data, The Cryosphere, doi:10.5194/tcd-9-6495-2015.

Note that individual descriptions should be included at the top of each script.

The 'calc' scripts are all used to process IceBridge ATM data into 'topography' datasets used by the 'plot' plotting scripts. 

Python 2.7 was used for all processing. I have not tested these scripts in Python 3.

ADD IN WHAT DATA WAS USED AND WHERE TO PUT IT!
